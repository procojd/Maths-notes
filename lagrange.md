# Lagrange’s Theorem (Group Theory)

## Statement
Let **G** be a finite group and **H** a subgroup of **G**.  
Then the order (number of elements) of **H** divides the order of **G**.  

Mathematically:
``|G| = [G : H] × |H|``  

Where:
- `|G|` = order of group G  
- `|H|` = order of subgroup H  
- `[G : H]` = index of H in G (the number of distinct left cosets of H in G)

---

## Proof Outline
1. Consider the set of **left cosets** of H in G:  
   `G = g₁H ∪ g₂H ∪ … ∪ gₖH`  

2. These cosets are:
   - Pairwise disjoint  
   - Each has the same number of elements as H  

3. Hence,  
   `|G| = [G : H] × |H|`  

This shows `|H|` divides `|G|`.

---

## Consequences
1. The **order of any subgroup** divides the order of the group.  
2. The **order of any element** `a ∈ G` (the smallest n such that aⁿ = e) divides `|G|`.  
   - Because `<a>` is a subgroup of G.  
3. Helps in classifying finite groups.

## Example 1
Let **G = S₃**, the symmetric group on 3 elements.  
- `|S₃| = 6`  

Possible subgroups:  
- Trivial subgroup `{e}` (order 1)  
- Cyclic subgroups generated by transpositions, e.g. `<(12)>` of order 2  
- Cyclic subgroup `<(123)>` of order 3  
- Whole group S₃ (order 6)  

Here, possible subgroup orders: **1, 2, 3, 6**, all divide 6 ✅

---

## Example 2
Let **G = Z₈**, the integers modulo 8 under addition.  
- `|Z₈| = 8`  

Subgroups:
- `<0>` = {0}, order 1  
- `<4>` = {0, 4}, order 2  
- `<2>` = {0, 2, 4, 6}, order 4  
- `<1>` = whole group, order 8  

Subgroup orders = {1, 2, 4, 8}, all divide 8 ✅

---

## Important Note
Lagrange’s theorem does **not** guarantee the existence of a subgroup of every divisor of `|G|`.  
- Example: A group of order 12 need not have a subgroup of order 6.  
- (Cauchy’s Theorem and Sylow Theorems deal with this).
